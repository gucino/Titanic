#purpose
1. To extract basic information by data visualisation
2. To predict the survival on Titanic using neural network
3. To assess the impact of each factor on survival rate


#information gain (refer to "all graph.docx")
-more male passenger than female
-more dead than survive
-number of third class passenger is the highest
 follow by first class and second class passenger
-highest portion of passenger age is 20 years old
-more than 70 percent of female survived while 
 only 20 percent of male survived
-youngest age range (less than 10 years old) survived the most
-first class passeneger has highest percentage of survival
 follow by second class and third class
